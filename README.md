# script.tvskipintro
Prompts dialog to Skip Intro for TV Shows. Skips intro for your favourite shows. The addon creates a database of your shows and stores a custom set skip value.

Pretty much the opposite of UpNext.

Each Value set is for Each TV Show INDIVIDUALLY, not per episode. 
So if you set the SkipIntro to 45 seconds, then for every episode for that title it will skip 45 seconds in.
